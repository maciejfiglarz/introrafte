It was popularised in the 1960s\n            with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages,\n            and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus\n            PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.\n            <div\n              onClick={this.handleClick}\n              style={this.getStyle(photo1)}\n              data-index={0}\n              className=\"portfolio__item\"\n            ></div>\n            <div\n              onClick={this.handleClick}\n              style={this.getStyle(photo2)}\n              className=\"portfolio__item\"\n              data-index={1}\n            ></div>\n            <div\n              onClick={this.handleClick}\n              style={this.getStyle(photo3)}\n              className=\"portfolio__item\"\n              data-index={2}\n            ></div>\n            <div\n              onClick={this.handleClick}\n              style={this.getStyle(photo4)}\n              className=\"portfolio__item\"\n              data-index={3}\n            ></div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\n// const Tables = ({ isTable, setIsTable }) => {\n//   const onClickTableClose = () => {\n//     setIsTable(!isTable);\n//   };\n//   return (\n//     <div className={`table ${isTable ? \"table--visible\" : \"\"}`}>\n//       <div className=\"table__inner container\">\n//         <div onClick={onClickTableClose} className=\"table__close\">\n//           <i className=\"fas fa-times\"></i>\n//         </div>\n//         <div className=\"table__content\" id=\"style-2\">\n//           What is Lorem Ipsum? Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing\n//           and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard\n//           dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley\n//           of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived\n//           not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic\n//           typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.

Why do we use it?\n//           It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the\n//           readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of\n//           using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of\n//           letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it\n//           look like readable English.\n//           <br></br>\n//           <br></br> Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now\n//           use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem\n//           ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various\n//           versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes\n//           on purpose (injected humour and the like). Where does it come from?\n//           Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It\n//           has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making\n//           it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at\n//           Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure\n//           Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going\n//           through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the\n//           undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and\n//           1.10.33 of \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" (The Extremes of Good and\n//           Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC.\n//           <br></br> <br></br> This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics,\n//           very popular during the Renaissance.
